# Dice Game ðŸš€

Welcome to Dice Game! This is a simple web-based game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Description

Dice Game is a two-player dice game. The players take turns rolling a dice. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player decides to "hold", their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more points wins the game.
