The user interacts with a series of small cups, clicking to fill them incrementally. A large cup dynamically updates to reflect the percentage of small cups filled, with a corresponding numerical display. The script intelligently adjusts for overflow and provides real-time feedback on the remaining fluid needed to reach the target. This interactive and visually appealing component can be seamlessly integrated into applications or websites focused on tracking water intake or similar fluid-related metrics.
